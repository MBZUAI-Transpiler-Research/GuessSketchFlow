Start by creating an environment or activating an existing one. Conda init then conda activate "name" although you may need to use bash for this to work.
After that do pip install -r requirements.txt inside the environment if you haven't already. This should have everything you need.
NOTE: if you add anything to the code that requires pip install, add it here. Otherwise it will make duplicating this work hard in another environment

Here is a very, very high level overview of guess:

1. Load model/config from `launch_spec_qwen.yaml` --- see launch_spec.py for notes on how this works
2. Initialize the `Guess` module --- be careful since it's autodeciding GPU's. 
3. Run `guess.guess()` to generate predictions. self.model.predict(instance, self.launch_spec.model_config) is called on each data instance, but details are in QwenModel.py
4. Save those predictions to `predictions.pkl` -- makes it easier to run sketch only without having to re-run guess
